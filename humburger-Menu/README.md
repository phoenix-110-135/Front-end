## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design:** The menu automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Smooth Animations:** Enjoy beautiful animations for opening and closing the menu, making the interaction more engaging.
- **Dynamic Cursor Effect:** A circular cursor follows your mouse movements, adding a unique touch to the user experience.

## 📄 Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

1. **HTML:** The structure of the webpage includes a hamburger icon and a navigation menu with various links. The menu is hidden by default and revealed when the hamburger icon is clicked.
  
2. **CSS:** The styles define the layout, colors, and animations of the hamburger menu. It includes styles for the hamburger icon, menu items, and transitions for smooth opening and closing effects.

3. **JavaScript:** This part handles the functionality of the menu toggle. When the hamburger icon is clicked, it triggers a function that adds or removes a class to the body, which controls the visibility of the menu. Additionally, it implements a dynamic cursor effect that follows the mouse pointer.
